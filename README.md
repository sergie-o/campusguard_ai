## üìñ The Story  

> University life isn‚Äôt just about passing exams ‚Äî it‚Äôs about balancing studies, mental health, and finances. Too often, students only realize they‚Äôre stressed, burned out, or financially stretched **after it‚Äôs already too late**.  

**CampusGuard AI** changes that.  
It acts as a *digital guardian*, predicting burnout and stress early, tracking wellbeing, and guiding students with data-driven recommendations.

## ‚ùå The Problem ‚Üí ‚úÖ The Solution  

![CampusGuard AI Flow](sandbox:/mnt/data/69CECD9B-2ABF-4FEE-A4DA-0E368152B274.png?_chatgptios_conversationID=68d0ffe7-85b0-8329-8554-a59162ae2d89&_chatgptios_messageID=55ac749c-5989-4d9f-8e86-58dad0c19044)  

- **Problem**: Student wellbeing is at risk due to **burnout, stress, financial pressure, and study-life imbalance**.  
- **Solution**: CampusGuard AI integrates **Machine Learning + GenAI** to predict risks, assist with solutions, and improve wellbeing.

## üéØ Project Overview  

**Challenge**: University students face a mental health crisis with 50%+ reporting high stress levels, yet current support systems are reactive rather than predictive.  

**Solution**: Built an end-to-end AI platform that predicts student burnout risk before crisis occurs using a novel dual-model machine learning architecture.  

**Impact**: Achieved 98% prediction accuracy on clinical data, with potential to reduce crisis interventions by 75% through early detection.

## üíª Technical Implementation  

### Core Architecture  

**Dual-Model ML System** - Designed and implemented two complementary models:  

1. **Direct Burnout Model (Logistic Regression)**  
   - 98% accuracy on 282 medical student dataset  
   - Uses validated MBI-SS psychological framework  
   - 7-feature model with scientific rigor  

2. **Proxy Stress Model (CatBoost)**  
   - Real-world deployment model using lifestyle indicators  
   - 1,100+ student dataset with 20 behavioral features  
   - Gradient boosting with class balancing and early stopping  

### Key Technical Achievements  

```python
def calculate_burnout_score(exhaustion, cynicism, academic_efficacy):
    """
    Custom risk scoring algorithm combining multiple psychological factors
    """
    # Feature normalization and composite scoring
    exhaustion_norm = normalize(exhaustion, 0, 5)
    cynicism_norm = normalize(cynicism, 0, 5)
    efficacy_inverted = 1 - normalize(academic_efficacy, 0, 5)
    
    # Weighted composite score
    return (exhaustion_norm + cynicism_norm + efficacy_inverted) / 3 / 3
